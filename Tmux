Basic tmux Commands

tmux uses a prefix key to trigger commands. By default, the prefix key is Ctrl + b. After pressing the prefix key, you can enter a command.

4. Detach and Reattach Sessions


In tmux, panels (also known as panes) can be resized, moved, and rearranged using various keybindings. Below are some common commands to manage panels in tmux:
1. Splitting Panes

    Split vertically: Ctrl-b %
    Split horizontally: Ctrl-b "

2. Navigating Between Panes

    Move to the next pane: Ctrl-b o
    Move to a specific pane: Ctrl-b q followed by the pane number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.)
    Move to the pane above: Ctrl-b Up Arrow
    Move to the pane below: Ctrl-b Down Arrow
    Move to the pane on the left: Ctrl-b Left Arrow
    Move to the pane on the right: Ctrl-b Right Arrow

3. Resizing Panes

    Resize pane to the left: Ctrl-b Ctrl-Left Arrow
    Resize pane to the right: Ctrl-b Ctrl-Right Arrow
    Resize pane up: Ctrl-b Ctrl-Up Arrow
    Resize pane down: Ctrl-b Ctrl-Down Arrow

4. Swapping Panes

    Swap with the previous pane: Ctrl-b {
    Swap with the next pane: Ctrl-b }

5. Closing Panes

    Close the current pane: Ctrl-b x (then confirm with y)

6. Changing Layouts

    Cycle through layouts: Ctrl-b Space
    Select a specific layout:
        Even-horizontal: Ctrl-b M-1
        Even-vertical: Ctrl-b M-2
        Main-horizontal: Ctrl-b M-3
        Main-vertical: Ctrl-b M-4
        Tiled: Ctrl-b M-5

7. Moving Panes to a New Window

    Move the current pane to a new window: Ctrl-b !

8. Breaking a Pane into a New Window

    Break the current pane into a new window: Ctrl-b :break-pane

9. Joining Panes

    Join the current pane with another pane: Ctrl-b :join-pane -t <target-pane>

10. Rotating Panes

    Rotate panes clockwise: Ctrl-b Ctrl-o
    Rotate panes counterclockwise: Ctrl-b M-o

11. Customizing Keybindings

    You can customize keybindings in your ~/.tmux.conf file. For example:

    bash

bind-key -n C-h select-pane -L

bind-key -n C-j select-pane -D

bind-key -n C-k select-pane -U

    bind-key -n C-l select-pane -R

    This would allow you to navigate panes using Ctrl-h, Ctrl-j, Ctrl-k, and Ctrl-l without needing to press Ctrl-b first.

12. Switching Panes with Mouse

    If mouse mode is enabled, you can click on a pane to switch to it. Enable mouse mode with:

    bash

    set -g mouse on

13. Renumbering Panes

    Renumber panes: Ctrl-b :move-pane -t <new-index>

14. Maximizing and Restoring Panes

    Maximize the current pane: Ctrl-b z
    Restore the pane to its original size: Ctrl-b z again

15. Swapping Panes with a Specific Pane

    Swap the current pane with a specific pane: Ctrl-b :swap-pane -s <source-pane> -t <target-pane>

These commands should help you manage and change panels in tmux effectively. You can always refer to the tmux manual (man tmux) for more advanced options and customization.
