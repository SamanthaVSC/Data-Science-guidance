Method 1: Using the Root Account

    Switch to the Root User: If you have access to the root account, you can switch to it by running:

    bash

su -

Enter the root password when prompted.

Add User to the Sudo Group: Once you are logged in as root, you can add the user samantha to the sudo group with the following command:

bash

usermod -aG sudo samantha

Exit the Root Session: After adding the user to the group, you can exit the root session:

bash

    exit

    Log Out and Log Back In: For the changes to take effect, log out of your current session and log back in.

Method 2: Editing the Sudoers File

If you don't have access to the root account, you will need to contact your system administrator to grant you sudo privileges. If you do have access to the root account, you can edit the sudoers file using the visudo command, which safely edits the file:

    Switch to the Root User: As mentioned above, switch to the root user.

    Edit the Sudoers File: Run the following command:

    bash

visudo

Add the User: Find the line that looks like this:

plaintext

root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Below it, add the following line to grant samantha sudo privileges:

plaintext

    samantha ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

    Save and Exit: Save the changes and exit the editor. In visudo, you typically save by pressing CTRL + O, then Enter, and exit with CTRL + X.

    Log Out and Log Back In: Again, log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Testing Sudo Access

After following one of the methods above, you can test if samantha has sudo access by running:

bash

sudo whoami

If everything is set up correctly, it should return root.
