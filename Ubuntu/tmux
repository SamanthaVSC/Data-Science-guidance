tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is a powerful terminal application that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. It is particularly useful for users who work in a command-line environment, as it enables them to split their terminal into multiple panes, detach and reattach sessions, and keep processes running even when they disconnect from the terminal.

Installation on Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install tmux

Basic Commands:

Start a new session:
tmux

Detach from a session: Press Ctrl + b, then d.

List sessions:
tmux ls

tmux uses a prefix key to trigger commands. By default, the prefix key is Ctrl + b. After pressing the prefix key, you can enter a command.
Common Commands
