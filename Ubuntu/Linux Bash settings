# How to access to Linux Bash settings
bash:
subl ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc # Reload bash to apply the changes once a change was made on bash

# Hide terminal information
subl ~/.bashrc
scroll down until the bottom and add this command line:
export PS1="\W \$"

# To store the path in a variable for later use:
current_path=$(pwd)
echo "You are in: $current_path"

# To Continuously Show the Current Path
function cd {
    builtin cd "$@" && current_path=$(pwd) && echo "You are in: $current_path"
}

# Modifying the Prompt, (Another way to always see your current path is to modify your shell prompt) find the line that sets the PS1, It might look something like this PS1='[\u@\h \W]\$ ' and modify it by this one: PS1='[\u@\h \w]\$ '
